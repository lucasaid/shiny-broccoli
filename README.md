# Shiny Broccoli

Repo of a basic template of my gulp process to whip up quick small projects. Probably only really useful for myself.

Also added is commitizen and cz-conventional-changelog to allow more standardised commit messages.

## Gulp

- gulp help: displays help
- gulp run: Compiles all the code, creates local server, watches for changes and opens site in browser.
- gulp build: compiles all the files.
